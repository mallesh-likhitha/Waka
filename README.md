In this project using R Shiny I am trying to visualize the various modes of transportation used by people in New Zealand to commute to work and to educational institutions. The aim is to have a quick overview of the data visually and also draw some meaningful insights.


The data used is in csv form and is downloaded from https://datafinder.stats.govt.nz/table/104720-2018-census-main-means-of-travel-to-work-by-statistical-area-2/webservices/.
